This one is fairly self-explanatory.

Heat the oven to 390°F (200°C)

Remove the casings from several sausages.
Fry the meat, as well as anything you think goes well with pork. Finely chopped apples work well.

Cut the tops off of some green peppers (one per person) and remove the ribs and seeds.
Stuff the peppers with the meat.

Bake for 20 minutes.
