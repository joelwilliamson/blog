Gwen's dad sent us a recipe for stir-fried shrimp with rice wine, and it turned out quite well.

Shell a pound of shrimp.

Heat ¼ cup of oil in a wok on high. Add 4 thinly sliced scallions and some chopped ginger. Cook until nicely fragrant.

Add the shrimp and cook fully.

Add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of rice wine. He recommended shàoxīng wine, but the LCBO near us only had saké, which worked fine. Simmer 2 or 3 minutes, then serve.
